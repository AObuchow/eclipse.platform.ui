Eclipse Platform Build Notes<br>
Workbench</h1>
Eclipse Integration Build 20030701 
<h2>What's new in this drop</h2>
<p><strong>First cut of the responsive UI work</strong>. Following on from the 
  job handling released by Core in M1 the UI team has released further support 
  for the Job framework in the UI. It is now possible to create an instance of 
  UIJob which will run in the UI Thread rather than in some other Thread supplied 
  by the JobManager. This is a requirement for any code that must interact with 
  an SWT component.</p>
<p>UIJob requires a Display to be able to run as it is run using an asynchExec. 
  This Display must be set before the UIJob is scheduled. If a UIJob is used then 
  the creator of the UIJob must also set the display to run it in and be sure 
  that that display exists when the code is executed. An alternative to UIJob 
  is the WorkbenchUIJob which will get a display from a WorkbenchWindow if one 
  is not set.WorkbenchUIJob is defined in the org.eclipse.ui.workbench project 
  and so it can be used by plugins with org.eclipse.ui.workbench as a prerequisite.</p>
<p>The first cut of the progress indicator is now also available. It is disabled 
  by default. You can enable it by adding the line <code>org.eclipse.ui.workbench/showProgressIndicator=true</code> 
  to the file plugin_customization.ini in org.eclipse.platform.</p>
