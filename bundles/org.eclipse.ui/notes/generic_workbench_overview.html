<h1>Generic workbench overview</h1>
<p>Last modified July 22, 2003</p>
<h4>What is a generic workbench?</h4>
<p>The &quot;generic workbench&quot; is the core of the Eclipse Platform UI
stripped of its former IDE-specific personality, predilections, and biases. The
high-level picture of the Eclipse workbench is painted in the <a href="http://eclipse.org/whitepapers/eclipse-overview.pdf">Eclipse
Technical Overview</a>. With minor modifications, it can paint a good high-level
picture of what we're calling the generic workbench (new or modified passages
are underlined):</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="LEFT">Unlike SWT and JFace, which are both general purpose UI
  toolkits, <u>the <i>workbench </i>provides overall UI organization and
  supplies the structures in which an application interact with the user</u>.
  The workbench API is dependent on the SWT API, and to a lesser extent on the
  JFace API. The workbench implementation is built using both SWT and JFace;
  Java AWT and Swing are not used.</p>
  <p align="LEFT">The Eclipse Platform UI paradigm is based on editors, views,
  and perspectives. From the user's standpoint, a workbench window consists
  visually of views and editors. Perspectives manifest themselves in the
  selection and arrangements of editors and views visible on the screen.</p>
  <i>
  <p align="LEFT">Editors </i>allow the user to open, edit, and save objects.
  They follow an open-save-close lifecycle much like file system based tools,
  but are more tightly integrated into the workbench. When active, an editor can
  contribute actions to the workbench menus and tool bar. <u>The generic
  workbench has no built-in editors. There is an separate plug-in containing the
  standard text editor and text editor framework. This plug-in is an optional
  component that can be used with the generic workbench in applications.</u></p>
  <i>
  <p align="LEFT">Views </i>provide information about some object that the user
  is working with in the workbench. A view may assist an editor by providing
  information about the document being edited. For example, the standard content
  outline view shows a structured outline for the content of the active editor
  if one is available. A view may augment other views by providing information
  about the currently selected object. For example, the standard properties view
  presents the properties of the object selected in another view. Views have a
  simpler lifecycle than editors: modifications made in a view (such as changing
  a property value) are generally saved immediately, and the changes are
  reflected immediately in other related parts of the UI. <u>The generic
  workbench has no built-in views. There are separate plug-ins containing the
  properties view, the content outline view, and the generic navigator view.
  These plug-ins are optional components that can be used with the generic
  workbench in applications.</u></p>
  <p align="LEFT">A workbench window can have several separate <i>perspectives</i>,
  only one of which is visible at any given moment. Each perspective has its own
  views and editors that are arranged (tiled, stacked, or detached) for
  presentation on the screen (some may be hidden at any given moment). Several
  different types of views and editors can be open at the same time within a
  perspective. A perspective controls initial view visibility, layout, and
  action visibility. The user can quickly switch perspective to work on a
  different task, and can easily rearrange and customize a perspective to better
  suit a particular task. <u>The generic workbench has no built-in perspectives.
  The application must supply at least a default perspective.</u></p>
  <p align="LEFT">Tools integrate into this editors-views-perspectives UI
  paradigm in well-defined ways. The main extension points allow tools to
  augment the workbench:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p align="LEFT">Add new types of editors.</li>
    <li>
      <p align="LEFT">Add new types of views.</li>
    <li>Add new perspectives, which arrange old and new views to suit new user
      tasks.</li>
  </ul>
  <p align="LEFT"><u>The properties view, the content outline view, the generic
  navigator view, the standard text editor, and the default perspective are all
  contributed using these mechanisms.</u></p>
  <p align="LEFT">Tools may also augment existing editors, views, and
  perspectives:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p align="LEFT">Add new actions to an existing view's local menu and tool
      bar.</li>
    <li>
      <p align="LEFT">Add new actions to the workbench menu and tool bar when an
      existing editor becomes active.</li>
    <li>
      <p align="LEFT">Add new actions to the pop-up content menu of an existing
      view or editor.</li>
    <li>
      <p align="LEFT">Add new views, action sets, and shortcuts to an existing
      perspective.</li>
  </ul>
  <p align="LEFT">The Platform takes care of all aspects of workbench window and
  perspective management. Editors and views are automatically instantiated as
  needed, and disposed of when no longer needed. The display labels and icons
  for actions contributed by a tool are listed in the plug-in manifest so that
  the workbench can create menus and tool bars without activating the
  contributing plug-ins. The workbench does not activate the plug-in until the
  user attempts to use functionality that the plug-in provides.</p>
  <p align="LEFT">Once an editor or view becomes an active part of a perspective
  it can use workbench services for tracking activation and selection. The part
  service tracks view and editor activation within the perspective, reporting
  activation and deactivation events to registered listeners. A view or editor
  can also register with the selection service as a source for selections. The
  selection service feeds selection change events to all parties that have
  registered interest. This is how, for example, the standard properties view is
  notified of the domain object selected in the currently active editor or view.</p>

<h4>How does the application create a generic workbench?</h4>
<p>In the Eclipse world, the &quot;main program&quot; for an application is an
IPlatformRunnable contributed to the org.eclipse.core.runtime.application
extension point. The IPlatformRunnable's run(Object args) method gets control
once the Eclipse Platform Runtime has brought itself into existence. The plug-in
that contributes this class is the first real plug-in to be activated. The
application is responsible for opening the workbench using
PlatformUI.createAndRunWorkbench. (PlatformUI is in the org.eclipse.ui API
package in the org.eclipse.ui plug-in.) This method creates the workbench, opens
the initial workbench window, and then processes UI events until the user calls
it quits.</p>
<h4>How does the application configure and control the generic workbench?</h4>
<p>The application is responsible for more that just bringing up the workbench.
The application is also responsible for configuring the workbench and its
windows. Without some configuration, the workbench window is useless because its
menu bar and tool bar are completely empty. The application must supply a <i>workbench
adviser</i> object when it creates the workbench. The various methods on the
workbench adviser are called at well-defined points in the life cycle of the
workbench, and it is by implementing these methods that the application has the
opportunity to configure the workbench. (It's called a workbench
&quot;adviser&quot; because this object influences how the workbench works. The
application does not &quot;implement&quot; the workbench; the implementation of
the workbench is still internal, meaning most of the mechanism is still hidden.)
The API for workspace adviser and other things that an application needs to
configure the workbench are located in the org.eclipse.ui.application package
(in the org.eclipse.ui plug-in). The API in this package is not of interest (or
use) to other plug-ins.</p>
<h4>What aspects of the workbench must the application configure?</h4>
<p>The application is involved in key global decisions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Does a workbench window have a title bar?</li>
  <li>Does a workbench window have a menu bar?</li>
  <li>Does a workbench window have a tool bar?</li>
  <li>Does a workbench window have a shortcut bar?</li>
  <li>Does a workbench window have a status line?</li>
  <li>What is the title string for a workbench window?</li>
  <li>What is the image that shows in the corner of a workbench window or
    workbench dialog?</li>
  <li>What is the application name?</li>
  <li>What are the menu items and associated actions/commands for a workbench
    window?</li>
  <li>What are the tool bar items and associated actions/commands for a
    workbench window?</li>
  <li>[<span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffff00">TBD</span>]</li>
</ul>
<h4>What about the Help system?</h4>
<p>[<span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffff00">TBD</span>]</p>
<h4>What about the Update Manager?</h4>
