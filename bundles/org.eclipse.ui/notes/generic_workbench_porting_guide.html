<h1>Eclipse 3.0 Porting Guide<br>
Generic Workbench</h1>
<p>Last revised July 21, 2003</p>
<p>In 3.0, the Eclipse Platform UI changed to separate out generic workbench
from IDE specifics. This resulted in changes to API packages and extension
points. This document describes how to port existing Eclipse 2.1 plug-ins to 3.0
in light of these changes.</p>
<p><i>[Under construction]</i></p>
<p>The org.eclipse.ui plug-in which used to be the main Platform UI plug-in, now
contains just the API and extension points for the generic workbench. Optional
and IDE-specific API and extension points have moved to other plug-ins;
IDE-specific functionality is now in the org.eclipse.ui.ide plug-in; text
editors are now in the org.eclipse.ui.ide plug-in;&nbsp; </p>
<p>The org.eclipse.ui.workbench plug-in was deleted. This was an internal UI
plug-in, which client plug-ins would not ordinarily reference (it has no
extension points, and all its API was re-exported by the org.eclipse.ui
plug-in). The classes in this plug-in's API packages are now in one of the other
UI plug-ins. The plug-in manifest file for a client plug-in that explicitly
requires the org.eclipse.ui.workbench plug-in should be changed to require (a
sufficient subset of) these plug-ins instead: org.eclipse.ui,
org.eclipse.ui.editors, org.eclipse.ui.views.navigator,
org.eclipse.ui.views.properties, org.eclipse.ui.views.contentoutline,
org.eclipse.ui.ide.</p>
